# Survival-Analysis
Survival Analysis project for the Data Science Masters.
The main goal of this project is to analyis the time to internship for my school students, and how smoking would affect the duration.

## Project info

The final report should answer these basic questions:

How many students partecipated in the interview
After data preparation, how many samples are usable for data analysis? How many samples were dropped (if any), and why?
How long does it take to obtain an internship?
Please report the median time (with a confidence interval), total number of students at the baseline, the total number of events observed, and the total number of censored observations.
Of these variables,. which ones have the most impact on the time to obtain an internship, and in which direction: cohort, age, educational background, having or not having children.

Bonus question: can you build a predictive model to identify students at high risk of a long search? How well does your model perform?


This work is the deliverable of the final assignment of Survival Analysis class at DSTI
